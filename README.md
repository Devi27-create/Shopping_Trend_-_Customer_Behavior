## Project Overview
The **Shopping Trends & Customer Behavior Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI report designed to analyze how customers shop — what they buy, how often, and under what conditions.  
Using data from 3,900 customers, the dashboard identifies **key behavioral patterns**, **spending habits**, **seasonal trends**, and **marketing opportunities**.

The project demonstrates how **5A's storytelling** can turn raw transactional data into **actionable business intelligence**.
